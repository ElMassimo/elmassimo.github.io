  <div class="post">
    <p>In this post I’d like to share a practice that has completely changed the way we
work: documentation as a first-class citizen in our software development process.</p>

<p>Documentation facilitates understanding, which is <em>vital</em> to enable
change and continuous improvement.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-helpful-thinking">How is it helpful? <img class="emoji" title=":thinking:" alt=":thinking:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f914.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>Traditionally, we aim to produce clean and maintainable code to make it more
reliable, and write tests to protect it. We use good variable names, split
functions that perform too much into simpler ones, and design them so that
parameter names convey enough information.</p>

<p>However, seeing <em>what</em> the code does is not the same as figuring out <em>why</em> it does it.</p>

<p>Most of the design process happens informally in chat rooms, conversations, and
online documents. As a result, understanding a decision that was made a long time
ago can be very time consuming, as it requires scanning through chat messages,
and reaching out to the people that were involved.</p>

<p>When we are not able to obtain enough information about these decisions, it
becomes harder to effectively reason about the software, slowing down fixes and
improvements.</p>

<p>This is why learning about past decisions should be as efficient and
straightforward as possible: it will save us a lot of time and frustration down
the line. Knowing the context will allow us to make informed decisions,
which are <em>better</em> decisions.</p>

<h2 id="best-time-to-start-was-years-ago-second-best-time-is-now-hourglass">Best time to start was years ago, second best time is now <img class="emoji" title=":hourglass:" alt=":hourglass:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/231b.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>If we are to make our software easier to understand, and thus easier to change,
we should <strong><em>document our intent</em></strong> in every possible way. Think about it as a
byproduct of the thought process we carry out as developers when designing a
solution and writing code.</p>

<p>Capture any breadcrumbs that might be useful in the future to find out how
things are supposed to work, helping other developers unravel the conditions
and mindset that influenced the code, even when we no longer remember why.</p>

<p><strong><em>Document as you go</em></strong>. No other time will be better to document than when the
ideas are fresh in our mind. Memories fade over time, and what we fail to
record then might be hopeless or painfully time-consuming to remember later.</p>

<p>The overhead of documenting on the spot is negligible, but the overall benefits
are certainly not!</p>

<h2 id="documenting-is-intrinsically-a-valuable-activity-moneybag">Documenting is intrinsically a valuable activity <img class="emoji" title=":moneybag:" alt=":moneybag:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4b0.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>To get the best out of it, we should imagine we are someone else trying to
understand our work. Which things will not be so obvious a few months from now?
Thinking about it can help to reveal our underlying assumptions and knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it clear how this component interacts with other parts of the system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By doing this mental exercise, we will be able to find simpler and more readable
ways to solve a problem, allowing us to refine our designs and solutions.
It has a direct positive impact in maintainability, regardless of whether
someone actually reads the resulting documentation.</p>

<p>Our focus should be on recording intent, <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> things <em>should</em> happen.
It’s also useful to cross-reference classes and objects that interact with each
other. Aim for the bigger picture, and work your way down as needed.</p>

<h2 id="a-lightweight-approach-is-good-enough-zap">A lightweight approach is good enough <img class="emoji" title=":zap:" alt=":zap:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a1.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>In practice, we’ve found that using a conventional but minimal
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ElMassimo/a118d08482d9db8e71d622e136f10155#which-format-to-use">syntax</a> for comments works well, and that it’s better to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ElMassimo/a118d08482d9db8e71d622e136f10155"><em><strong>inline documentation</strong></em></a> in the code itself.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Public: Abbreviation of a few words that sums up what the question is about.</span>
<span class="c1"># Example: 'Side Effects'</span>
<span class="n">field</span> <span class="ss">:title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">type: </span><span class="no">String</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inline docs are always at hand, require very low effort to add and update, and
are very helpful for developers to gain insight (both during reviews and in the long run).</p>

<p>They should be clear and concise. Don’t overstate the obvious and remove any
words that feel unnecessary. <em><strong>Creating good documentation takes practice</strong></em>,
it’s more about writing skills and less about programming.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to generate documentation pages from a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ElMassimo/a118d08482d9db8e71d622e136f10155#which-format-to-use">minimal syntax</a>,
usually navigating through the source code and reading the inline docs is more
convenient. Using <em>Goto Symbol</em> or <em>Goto Definition</em> on any <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">editor</a> does the trick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Won’t the comments become outdated really quickly? <img class="emoji" title=":scream_cat:" alt=":scream_cat:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f640.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="version-control-to-the-rescue-">Version control to the rescue! 🦸</h2>

<p>More often than not, the core concepts in the software we write rarely change,
so the documentation tends to be useful even when not entirely accurate.</p>

<p>Combined with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">source control</a>, even when the comments are
outdated, the original intention is never lost. We can navigate back through
history and get the full context in which the documentation was written.</p>

<p>In the same way we should document our intent in methods, properties, and classes,
it’s also important to capture the broader purpose of changes in commits. This
will enable us to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame">look back to learn more</a>, saving us an
invaluable amount of time when trying to understand past decisions.</p>

<p>As a result, we can move forward with deeper undestanding and confidence,
refactoring or removing code without fear of accidentally breaking the app, or
going against an otherwise long-forgotten decision.</p>

<h2 id="pull-requests-as-the-unit-of-change-">Pull Requests as the unit of change 🧩</h2>

<p>Usually in a team environment, the <em>pull request</em> replaces the <em>commit</em> as the <em>unit
of change</em>. Besides providing a platform for code review, pull requests are
great for adding rich non-text information, such as images and video, and
hyperlinks to external resources.</p>

<p>As a result, they also have an immense potential for communication and
documentation. We should leverage the description to explain substantial changes
(<em>why</em> and <em>what for</em>), provide screenshots, and any content that makes it
easier to follow the work.</p>

<p>Doing so will leave a solid trail that can help anyone grasp the full picture
later on, in addition to improving the communication and quality of the reviews.
Two for one!</p>

<h2 id="tldr-document-all-the-things-pencil2-book">TL’DR: Document all the things! <img class="emoji" title=":pencil2:" alt=":pencil2:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/270f.png" height="20" width="20"> <img class="emoji" title=":book:" alt=":book:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4d6.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>Code is read a lot more often than it’s written, which is why inline docs
provide a great return for their tiny cost. Same can be said about writing
a nice pull request description, describing specific decisions in comments,
and providing screenshots.</p>

<p>We’ve saved a lot of time when figuring out how things work, enabled our team to
refactor with confidence, prevented problems and regressions, and made entire
areas of the app more approachable for other developers.</p>

<p>The simple practice of documenting helps junior and senior developers alike, and
after you start using it, you’ll be wondering why you didn’t start sooner <img class="emoji" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

          <p>Today I’d like to share a simple but very useful practice for managing Ruby and
JS code under version control.</p>

<p>In our team, we always use trailing commas when defining multi-line literals for
arrays and hash (object in JS) literals.</p>

<p>It’s great that both Ruby and JS allow this in their syntax, because as a result
we are able to get cleaner diffs:</p>
