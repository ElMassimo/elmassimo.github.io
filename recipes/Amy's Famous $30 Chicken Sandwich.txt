Amy's Famous $30 Chicken Sandwich

Stuff for it
3 chicken thighs, bone in
1 tomato
1 ball of fresh mozzarella
1 red onion
1 small package of fresh basil
1 small package of spinach
1 little bottle of pesto
Mayo
A loaf of country bread, or ciabatta

More or Less How To:
Buy a package of chicken thighs, bone in. Use a sharp knife to carve the bone out of the thigh, add salt and pepper the meat (don't bother patting dry) then sautee in a big pan with a olive oil, skin down first on medium-high for like seven minutes, then flip it (should brown on both sides, flip it after it releases from a non-stick pan). Transfer the chicken to a cutting board with a slotted spoon (keep the grease in the pan) and slice it into 1inch pieces (lay it out longwise, then cut strips, then cut once in half). Add it back to the pan if it's not cooked through for another five minutes on a high heat; then remove and set aside.

That pan now has a ton of awesome oil and gravy and bits. Drain 2/3 of it, and then toast the bread (like a ciabata, or the center pieces of a big round loaf) for 4-5 minutes per side on a medium heat, slowly adding back in the gravy/stock/oil so the pan stays wet but not soo much that the bread is filled with oil.

Slice crosswise fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and thinly slice a red onion. 

Buy some premade pesto and mayo, mix about 1 part pesto to 5 parts mayo, to taste.

Stack: Bread, pesto-mayo, chicken, mozzarella, tomatoes, onion, add 50/50 fresh basil and baby spinach, more pesto-mayo, bread.

Serves only 2. Leftover ingredients make a great omelet the next day.
